                Climbing chalk always seems to be something that climbers run out of. Chalk drys out climbers hands and helps their grip significantly. Also, it's the #1 thing climbers blame when they fall off the wall. Whether you have sweaty hands, or you need a little edge on your climbing game, climbing chalk is a great way to go. Not to mention, Black Diamond is one of the most reputable brands and at this price, this is a no-brainer.
