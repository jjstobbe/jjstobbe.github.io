                Climbing is more than just an activity for me, it is an escape.             
            </p>
            <p>
                It serves a number of purposes in my life, but most importantly, it is something that makes me happy. Climbing lets my mind wander far away from any thoughts or worries I might have. There’s something special about how climbing takes your focus. When you’re on the wall it draws your attention in so deeply, that all you can think about is climbing. Perhaps it is the instinctive fear of falling that keeps my mind from wandering, or perhaps it’s simply from the innate difficulty of the sport. In either case, when the world does nothing but add stress and pressure to my life, climbing serves as a perfect release. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a famous rock climber Alex Honnold once said “I’m not thinking about anything when I’m climbing, which is part of the appeal. I’m focused on executing what’s in front of me”.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite what many people seem to believe, climbing isn’t an intensive adrenaline ride. If you climb well, you will understand that it is much closer to a calm dance than it is anything else. Look at any professional climber. They move up the wall slowly and meticulously, making progress one move at a time. Putting as little effort as possible into every move so as to preserve their strength for the climb ahead. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Take it from one of the leading free solo climbers in the world, “There is no adrenaline rush. If I get an adrenaline rush, it means that something has gone horribly wrong”.            
            </p>
            <p>
                In a way, climbing serves as a calming change of pace for me. When I need to step away from life I look towards rock climbing to find solace. As someone who is incredibly anxious at nearly every moment in life, the nature of rock climbing settles me unlike anything else. I don't know what I would do without it.
