                <p>
                    Sponsored by UNO, a team and myself were tasksed with developing an application that would utilize virtual reality. We decided to develop a
                    driving simulator to help driving students learn to drive without the risk of hurting themselves or others.

                  <li><span>Sudoku Solver:</span> I decided to create a sudoku solver that mimics human solution strategies. It was useful for learning how to move thoughts into code. </li>
                  <li><span>Screensavers:</span> I've created a variety of screensavers using the Java applet. Most of which involve mapping parametric functions. </li>
                  <li><span>Chess:</span> Quickly created a 2-player chess game. Allows the players to make moves, but stops them from making illegal moves. </li>

                    I have had a lot of experience within photoshop and now recently Illustrator! Most of the images I created were for presentations, my resume, snapchat geofilters, or just from
                    me experimenting with the programs. Linked is a gallery of some of the images I've created. </a>

                    This website itself is a project of mine! This is meant as a demo site to learn a little about web development. I took the time to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery to improve my web development
                    skills.
